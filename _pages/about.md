I'm a research assistant to **[Prof. Vineet Gandhi](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vgandhi/)** at the **[Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/)**, a research lab for computer vision in the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad. Prior to this, I worked extensively as a full-stack developer for four years after completing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Birla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS), Hyderabad. 

I'm deeply passionate about the intersection of computer vision and sports, with an intent to build innovative products that can enhance the experience of people involved in sports, be it teams, players or broadcasters. My engagement in sports is primarily influenced as viewer and an avid fan  I've also dipped my toes into speech synthesis, focused towards accesibility and synthesizing speech through various input modalities such as text, lip-sequences etc.
